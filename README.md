# CSUSM CS/CIS page
For our Capstone project at California State University San Marcos, I (along with three other students in my team) designed an appendix to the official university's website that aim to provide helpful academic resources for first-time college students who wish to major in a Computer Science related field. It also offers resources for new sponsors to offer opportunities for students to work for real life clients using the skills they learned from their previous courses.

# About This Repository
This repository serves as an online resource for CSUSM freshmen who are planning to major in a Computer Science related field (Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Software Engineering, etc.). It contains key information that may not be covered in depth by the official CSUSM website, including:

* **CS major comparisons** - The site gives an in-depth comparison between Computer Science and Computer Information Systems in terms of skills emphasized and job outlook, neatly organized in a Venn diagram.
* **CS Questionaire** - A Typeform survey that determines which CS major best suits you based on your responses.
* **Capstone information** - A detailed overview of Capstone projects in general.
* **Project Portfolio** - A list of all the Capstone projects that CSUSM has done since 2014. Users can filter what they want to see using the sidebar.
* **Sponsor Form** - New sponsors who wish to contribute to the students' learning can apply to be a sponsor at the university. They are reviewed by the faculty of the university and will follow up with the sponsor if they are interested.

**Disclaimer: This is an unofficial resource, created by students and alumni. While we strive for accuracy, always refer to the official university website for official policies, course catalogs, and academic requirements.**
