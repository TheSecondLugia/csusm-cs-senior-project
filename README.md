For our Capstone project at California State University San Marcos, I (along with three other students in my team) designed an appendix to the official university's website that aim to provide helpful academic resources for first-time college students who wish to major in a Computer Science related field. It also offers resources for new sponsors to offer opportunities for students to work for real life clients using the skills they learned from their previous courses.

This appendix is currently unofficial and has been submitted to the IT department of the university for approval to be added to the official university website.
